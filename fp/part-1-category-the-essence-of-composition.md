## What is Category

A category consists of objects and morphisms.  Morphisms can be composed, and the composition is associative.

Every object has an identity morphism that is, a unit under composition.

- Objects, Morphisms, and Composition consist Category.
- Associativity and Identity are the axioms of Category theory.

## What is Programming

When we solve problem that is hard enough, we often break down the problem into subproblems, because our brain does not have an ability to solve those kinds of complex problems, at once.

So we separate the problems and solve each of them, and then combine those solutions to get the solutions of more larger problems, and eventually we get the solution of the original problem.

This is the essence of programming - decomposition & composition. And it is also how our brain works too.

> We need structure not because well-structured programs are pleasant to look at, but because otherwise our brains canâ€™t process them efficiently.

So we need right chunks for the composition of programs. What are the "right chunks"? Once we have implemented a program, forget about the details, and focus on the behavior - the interface, or the surface, of the program.

> If you have to dig into the implementation in order to know how to compose it with others, you will lost the adventages of your programming paradigm.
