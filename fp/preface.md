## Why should we consider learning category theory - or functional programming?

- Changes in hardware

  multicore CPUs introduces concurrency and parallelism

- Growing complexity of software

  Functions with side effects don't scale, and imperative programming is all about side effects.

We have to fix the foundations of programming - If we want to move forward.

## Conclusion

Programming Skills - they were built on very flimsy foundations. If we want to move forward, we should rethink about the foundations of programming, and fix those.
