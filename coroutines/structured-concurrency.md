# Structured Concurrency

## Relation to structured programming

Structured concurrency is analogous to structured programming, which introduces control flow of statements - if/else, for loops, etc.

## Structured concurrency is new

Structured concurrency is relatively new concept. According to Wikipedia..

> The concept was formulated in 2016, by Martin Sústrik, and then further refined in 2018 by Nathaniel J. Smith. Meanwhile, Roman Elizarov independently came upon the same ideas while develoing an experimental coroutine library for the Kotlin language.
