### What's the difference between force, work, energy, and power?

> A force is any interaction between physical objects that is able to cause a change in an object’s momentum. The physical quantity is treated as a “vector”, meaning it has both a size and a direction. Forces are exerted on objects. It is never correct to say an object “has force”.

> But we do say that objects “have energy”. Energy is a scalar quantity, it has no direction, and it is sort of an abstract accounting tool that we use to account for all sorts of changes in a system that are the result of forces acting on objects. Energy is sometimes defined as “The capacity to do work”, where work is defined as a force times a distance.

> Work is the product of a component of a force on an object times the displacement of the object while the force is being exerted in the direction fo displacement.

> Work is a scalar. Work is done on something or by something. Another way of understanding Work is that Work is "a change in energy via a force."

> the point is that work "changes the energy of something" and the change is "through the application of a force." - Work can increase or decrease energy.

> Energy is the ability to work. - meaning that work "can be done."

So here's key differences:

- Force is a vector quantity. It's an interaction between physical objects exerted to one by another object. Unit of force is kg * m * s^-2.
- Energy is a scalar quantity. It's an abstract representation of the results of the interaction in terms of the work being done. Unit of energy is kg * m^2 * s^-2.
- Work is a scalar quantity. It's the changes of Energy via force. Unit of work is also kg * m^2 * s^-2.
- Work is done on something. Energy is something transffered to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat. So Work is something that is "done", and Energy is something that is "transferred".
- Power is the rate of doing work, or the amount of energy transffered per time.

#### Work-energy principle

The work W done by the resultant force on a particle equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy Ek.

W = delta(Ek) = 0.5m(v1^2 - v2^2)

Where v1 and v1 are the speeds of the particle before and after the work is done, and m is its mass.

#### Equations

Power - the amount of energy transffered per time:

P = dW / dt (W is work and t is time, d means delta)

Work - A force applied over a distance or changes of energy via force
Energy - an abstract representation of the results of the interaction, transffered to an object in order to perform work on:

W = F * s (F is force and s is displacement)

Force - An interaction that changes the motion of an object - changes its velocity.

F = m * a (m is mass of the object and an acceleration)

### According to Newton's thrid law, the action - acting of some force always has a reaction paired with it. Then what is a reaction if a wizard use some mana to life up an object?

> It is important to keep in mind that the force is on the object that accelerates.  Another way to state this is that objects cannot accelerate themselves.  You cannot push yourself back (or forwards).  But if you push a heavy object like a desk forwards, then the desk can push you back.

So.. In order to life up or push an object, there should be another object that exerts a force on the target object.

### Types of energy

Types of energy can be categorised into two broad categories – kinetic energy (the energy of moving objects) and potential energy (energy that is stored).
