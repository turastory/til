## SOLID principles

There are 5 fundamental principles in OOP. For this moment, the descriptions are short and need more explanations.

Although these principles are important, what's more important is the applications.
Let's find out the use cases and problems that can be solved by using these principles.

- S - Single Responsibility Principle

  A class should have one and only reason to change.

- O - Open Closed Principle

  You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying it.

- L - Liskov Substitution Principle

  A derived class should be able to substitute the base class.

- I - Interface Segregation Principle

  A class should not depend on interfaces that it does not use.

- D - Dependnecy Inversion Principle

  Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

  The name "Dependency inversion" comes from the fact that
  the graph of the dependencies between components is opposite to the control flow of them.
