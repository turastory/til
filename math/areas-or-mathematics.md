# Areas of Mathematics

## Foundations

- Mathematical logic

  Mathematical study of logic, and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics.

  Modern logic is divided into "recursion theory", "model theory", and "proof theory", and is closely linked to "theoretical computer science", as well as to "category theory".

- Theoretical computer science

  - Computability theory

    Studies the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including Turing machine.

  - Complexity theory

    Studies complexity of computations. Involves P=NP problem.

  - Information theory

    It is concerned with the amount of data, that can be stored on a given medium - deals with concepts such as "compression" and "entrophy"

- Set theory

  Studies sets or collections of objects.

- Category theory

  Deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relations between them.

## Pure mathematics

### Quantity

- Numbers

  Natural numbers, whole numbers

  Number theory Studies deeper properties of integers.

  Fermat's last theorem, twin prime conjecgture, etc.

- Real numbers

  Used to represent continuous quantities.

- Complex numbers

  Generalization of real numbers.

  Quaternions, octonions are derived from this concept.

- Transfinite numbers, cardinal numbers

  Formalizes the concept of "Infinity"

  Allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

### Structure

> Many mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal "structure" as a "consequence of operations or relations" that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies "properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure".

- Number theory

  Studies properties of the set of integers, that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations.

- Abstract algebra

  Studies similar properties of structures by a step of abstraction. States axioms for a class of structures, and then study the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms.

  Groups, rings, fields, and other abstract systems.

- Linear Algebra

  General study of vector spaces - whose elements called vectors  have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model points in space.

  -> This is one example of strong interactions between geometry and algebra.

- Combinatorics

  Studies ways of "enumerating" the number of objects that "fit" a given structure.

### Space

- Geometry combines space and numbers.

  non-Euclidean geometries and topology, generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry.

- Trigonometry delas with relationships between the sides/angles of triangles with the trigonometric functions.

- Analytics/Differential/Algebraic geometry combines quantity and space. They use some other areas' mathematical approaches to solve their own problems.

- Convex, discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and function analysis, but now is applied to optimization and computer sciences.

  Think about the graph of quadratic function. The latter says about gradient-descent or something like that, maybe.

- Topology

- Fractal geometry

- Measure theory

### Change

> Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity.

Function describes "a changing quantity". Calculus, vector calculus, differential equations are belongs here.

- Real analysis

  Studies real numbers and functions of a real variable.

- Complex analysis

  Studies complex numbers and functions of a complex variable.

- Functional analysis

  Focuses attention on spaces of functions. One of applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics.

- Differential Equations

  Studies relationships between a quantity and its rate of change.

- Dynamical systems

  A system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. Many phenomena in nature can be described by it.

- Chaos theory

  Deals with many systems that is unpredictable, yet still deterministic.

  Focues study of chaos - states of dynamical systems whose apperently random states of disorder and irregularities are often goverened by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.

## Applied mathematics

> Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge.

### Statistics + decision sciences

- Game theory
- Probability theory
- Statistics

### Computational mathematics

- Numerical analysis
- Optimization
- Cryptography
