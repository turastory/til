# Today I Learned

My personal study notes are in this repository. All notes are writtn in markdown format and English.

Edits: I realized that this writing down activity is called "TIL - Today I Learned". So I changed the name of the repository.

## Questions

Here I list some questions and problems that I'm trying to solve, with related keywords.

- [ ] (Android) How to reuse the behavior of activity/fragment, by using composition, not inheritance?
  
  Keywords: Liskov substitution principle, composition over inheritance, delegation pattern

- [ ] (Kotlin) CPS - Can we replace callbacks with suspending functions forever?

  If CPS is just a fancy name of a callback, then why not replace it with a suspending function?

- [ ] (Android) Can coroutines solve the problem of animations/transitions in modern architectures like MVP, MVVM?

  In MVVM, typically we use ViewModel and LiveData to manage/expose data to View. ViewModel only handles the state of the View, not the animations. Maybe coroutines can help.

- [ ] (Software Engineearing) Can I make a programming language that natively supports structured concurrency? Where should I start?
