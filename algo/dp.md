## What is different from divde-and-conquer? 

In divide-and-conquer algorithm, subproblems are disjoint to others.
In dynamic programming, subproblems share subsubproblems. - subproblems overlap.

### Key concept

In DP, we solve each subproblem once and save its result, and later use it to avoid duplicate computations.
